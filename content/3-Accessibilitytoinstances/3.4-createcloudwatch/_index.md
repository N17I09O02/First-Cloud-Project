Earlier, we established a connection to the public instance without opening SSH port 22, which enhances security by preventing attacks on the SSH port.  
One downside of the above approach is that we had to open outbound port 443 to the internet in the security group. Since this is a public instance, it might not be an issue, but if you want even more security, you can block outbound port 443 while still using Session Manager. We will go through this method in the private instance section below.
